# RSA-Virtual-Network-

RSA Algorithm ( Encryption and Decryption ) the program should take p,q,m,e as input to the sender machine to calculate C and send it to the Receiver, The receiver machine should calculate the decryption key "d" then perform the decryption process.  
Encryption and decryption should be performed on separate machine connected via network (virtual).
